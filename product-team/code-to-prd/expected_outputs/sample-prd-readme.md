## Global Notes

### Permission Model
Role-based access: ADMIN (full access), MANAGER (read + edit), USER (read-only).

### Common Interaction Patterns
- All delete operations require confirmation modal
- Lists default to `created_at` descending, 20 items per page
- Form validation shows inline errors below each field
